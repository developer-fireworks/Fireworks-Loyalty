## Understanding the Report

### Interpreting the Pie Chart

**What to Look For:**

1. **Tier Balance**
   - Is one tier dominating?
   - Are tiers relatively balanced?
   - Are there any unexpected distributions?

2. **Tier Growth**
   - Compare current to previous period
   - Track upward mobility (Tourist → Silver → Gold → Platinum)
   - Monitor downward movement (tier downgrades)

3. **Program Health**
   - Growing upper tiers = successful engagement
   - Large Tourist tier = acquisition focus needed
   - Shrinking lower tiers = strong loyalty

### Example Analysis

**Scenario 1: Healthy Program**
```
Platinum: 15%
Gold: 25%
Silver: 45%
Tourist: 15%
```
**Interpretation**: Balanced pyramid with strong mid-tier base and healthy premium segment.

**Scenario 2: Top-Heavy Program**
```
Platinum: 40%
Gold: 30%
Silver: 20%
Tourist: 10%
```
**Interpretation**: Mature program with highly engaged members, may need acquisition focus.

**Scenario 3: Bottom-Heavy Program**
```
Platinum: 5%
Gold: 10%
Silver: 25%
Tourist: 60%
```
**Interpretation**: Growing program with high acquisition but retention challenge.
